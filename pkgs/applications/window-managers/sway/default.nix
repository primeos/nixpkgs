    longDescription = ''
      Sway is a tiling Wayland compositor and a drop-in replacement for the i3
      window manager for X11. It works with your existing i3 configuration and
      supports most of i3's features, plus a few extras.
      Sway allows you to arrange your application windows logically, rather
      than spatially. Windows are arranged into a grid by default which
      maximizes the efficiency of your screen and can be quickly manipulated
      using only the keyboard.
